# CheminTF: Transformer-based Foundation Model for Trajectory Prediction

## Repository for the Sigspatial 2025 tutorial: Building a Foundation Model for Trajectory from Scratch

CheminTF is a an educational model repository for the SIGSPATIAL 2025 tutorial on building a foundation model for trajectory prediction from scratch.

## Repository structure

The repository has two main directories:
- `src`: Contains the source code for the model, including data processing, model architecture, training scripts, and evaluation scripts. It is meant to be a reusable codebase for building trajectory prediction models.
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks that contains the same code as the `src` directory, but with additional explanations, visualizations, and is self-contained for educational purposes. It is meant to be a learning resource for understanding the model and its components.


## Opening the notebooks in Google Colab

In the notebooks directory, there is chemintf which is meant to be followed during the tutorial presentation, other
notebooks are meant to be used as a learning resource.

To open the main notebook in Google Colab, click on the following link

## Datasets

The datasets used in the tutorial are listed in the [DATASETS.md](https://github.com/GaspardMerten/cheminTF/blob/main/DATASETS.md) file.
